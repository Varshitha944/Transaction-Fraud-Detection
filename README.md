# 🛡️ Transaction Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📖 Overview

Transaction Fraud Detection is a Machine Learning project developed to identify whether a banking transaction is **Fraudulent** or **Genuine** based on transaction details. The project applies data preprocessing, feature scaling, multiple machine learning algorithms, and a Flask web application to provide real-time fraud prediction along with an analytics dashboard.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Financial fraud has become one of the major challenges faced by banks and financial institutions. Detecting fraudulent transactions manually is difficult due to the increasing number of daily transactions.

The objective of this project is to develop a Machine Learning model that accurately classifies transactions as **Fraudulent** or **Genuine** and provides live predictions through a web-based application.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and understand the transaction dataset.
- Perform data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Encode categorical features.
- Scale numerical features.
- Train multiple Machine Learning models.
- Compare model performance.
- Select the best-performing model.
- Build a Flask web application for live predictions.
- Develop an Analytics Dashboard for visualization.
